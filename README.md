#Comparative Biology, part one.

Hi everyone, here you have my first repository where you will find the topics what we saw (with @Fer) on our Comparative Biology course with @Dmirandae.

I've divided all the content of this repository into 3 files:
Topics, where you will see my codes about the topics of the course.
Project, where you will find the necessary data for running my project.
Writings, where you will read the final PDFs what I wrote with the results of my project.
