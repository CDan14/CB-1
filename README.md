#Comparative Biology, part one.

Hi everyone, here you have my first repository where you will find the topics what we saw (with @fervillam) on our Comparative Biology course with @Dmirandae.

I've divided all the content of this repository into 3 files:
__Topics__, where you will see my codes about the topics of the course.
__Project__, where you will find the necessary data for running my project.
__Writings__, where you will read the final PDFs what I wrote with the results of my project.
